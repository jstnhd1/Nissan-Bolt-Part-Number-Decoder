# Nissan-Bolt-Size-Part-Number-Decoder
simple python code to extract Bolt sizes from part number should work with nissan, datsun, and infinity early 70s and up

this is my first piece of code its not perfect but it works.
run with 
$python ./decode_bolt.py

you will be asked: 
Enter the part number: example (08120-61628)

the output will be somthing like:
-6 mm None Hexagon bolt 16mm None

the bolt for part number 08120-61628 has a diameter of 6mm and a leangth of 16mm
